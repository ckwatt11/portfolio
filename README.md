# portfolio

Personal Portfolio website implemented with Python(Django), HTML and CSS. 

To run it, go to portfolio/mywebsite via a terminal and run `python manage.py runserver`. This should start the server and make the website accessible on port 8000. 
Then simply open your web browser and go to `localhost:8000`.


I am currently working to set up a remote server to make this website universally accessible through its own unique URL.
